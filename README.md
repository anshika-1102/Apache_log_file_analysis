# Apache_log_file_analysis
This project focuses on the analysis of Apache log files, extracting valuable insights from web server data. The primary tasks accomplished include:

1. Log File Parsing: Parsing Apache log files to extract relevant information such as IP addresses, timestamps, platform, URLs, and response codes.
2. Data Manipulation: Performing various operations on the extracted data to derive meaningful statistics and metrics.
3. Visualization: Utilizing data visualization techniques to present key findings. Bar graphs have been specifically employed to illustrate patterns and trends in the log data.

# Technologies Used
Python: Leveraged Python for log file parsing, data manipulation, and visualization.
Matplotlib: Employed Matplotlib for creating informative bar graphs.

Future Work
Enhanced Analytics: Explore advanced analytics techniques to extract deeper insights from log data.
